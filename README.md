# American Sign Language Recognition System 

A deep learning-based system for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using a combination of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for Alphabets and numbers, **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)** for static two-hand gestures, and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for dynamic sign recognition.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent system capable of recognizing both static and dynamic ASL gestures. It consists of three core modules:

- 🖼️ **CNN Model** — Recognizes static signs (A-Z, 0–9) from cropped hand images.
- 🧠 **MLP Model** — Classifies static two-hand signs based on landmark coordinates.
- 🎥 **LSTM Model** — Detects dynamic signs using time-sequenced landmark data.

 ## Directions

 Each folder contains data collection, pre-processing, training and testing files for each type of model: CNN, MLP, and LSTM
